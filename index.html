    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">CSS is not necessary</li>
        <li><mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li style="text-decoration:underline">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal- by usinga style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External- by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<span style="background-color: yellow;"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p style="color:brown;font:bolder;font-size: large; font-weight: 900;">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p style="color:brown;font-size: x-small;">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targete, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements</p>
    <p style="color:brown;font-style:  italic; font-weight: 900;"><span>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</span></p>
